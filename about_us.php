                <h4>Her side of the story</h4>
                <p>Welcome to our wedding website! We are so excited to share 
                    our special day with all of our loved ones. It's been a long 
                    journey to get here, but we are thrilled to finally tie the knot 
                    and start the next chapter of our lives together.
                    We met by chance at a mutual friend's party, and from that moment, 
                    we knew there was something special between us. We spent hours talking 
                    and laughing, and we felt an instant connection that only grew stronger 
                    with time. We've been through so much together, from long-distance to career 
                    changes, and everything in between. But no matter what, we've always had each 
                    other's backs and have always found a way to make it work.                
                    Our wedding day is a celebration of our love, but it's also a celebration 
                    of the people who have supported us along the way. We can't wait to share this 
                    special day with our friends and family and create new memories that will last a lifetime.</p>

                <p>Thank you for visiting our wedding website! 
                We are beyond excited to start this new chapter of our lives together and 
                share our special day with all of our loved ones.
                I knew from the moment I met her that she was the one. 
                She was smart, beautiful, and had a heart of gold. 
                We've been through so much together, from moving across the country 
                to pursuing our dreams, and we've always been there for each other 
                every step of the way.
                Our wedding day is a celebration of our love, but it's also a celebration 
                of the people who have helped us get here. From our families to our friends, 
                we are grateful for all of the support and love that has been shown to us. 
                We can't wait to exchange our vows, dance the night away, 
                and start this new journey as husband and wife. 
                Thank you for being a part of our love story!</p>
